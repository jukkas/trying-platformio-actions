# Learning and experimenting Github actions for a PlatformIO project

This project is for me to learn about Github Actions CI/CD,
and how to use CI/CD for a microcontroller firmware development and deployments.

In this instance, I use ESP32 for a microcontroller and PlatformIO with Arduino
libraries for a build system. 

## Status

After tagging a commit, included workflow now setups PlatformIO, builds ESP32 firmware,
and uploads the firmware to a Webdav server.

## TODO

- Add OTA firmware update to ESP32 project?
